OCPP1.6J test tool OCTT

OCPP1.6J test tool OCTT is officially released by OCA and is authoritative.

The latest version is 1.4.3.

The software includes installation manual and test case manual.

It can be used to test the behavior of charging piles or OCPP servers.

A detailed test report will be generated after the test case is executed.

I have rich experience in OCPP development, testing, and integration. Please feel free to contact.
